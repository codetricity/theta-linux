# RICOH THETA Development on Linux

![header](images/banner.jpg)

## Overview

Stream 360 video, control the RICOH THETA API, and supply power to
the camera using the USB cable.  It's awesome!

Video to your Linux computer is 4K at 30fps with under 30ms latency. 
Works with the RICOH THETA V or RICOH THETA Z1.  It's perfect for
OpenCV object detection, autonomous drones, building analysis,
AI, and TensorFlow projects.

The camera can be powered from the USB cable and can switch
into live streaming mode, still image, video, or bracket shooting
using API commands. We explain the tools, the repos, and the 
API.

Up to date guides, events, and a general pile of great stuff is at the
 [theta360.guide Linux Streaming Site](https://theta360.guide/special/linuxstreaming/).

 It's an exciting world.  Let's getting started.
