### September 1, 2020 - First Linux Meetup

45 people signed up and 17 people attended.  Due to the 
US health situation, the meetup was online only using Zoom Pro. It 
lasted 20 minutes past the planned 60 minutes due to active
questions.

In addition to configuration questions for libuvc-theta and 
libuvc-theta-sample, we showed two Linux streaming 
demos from a Jetson
Nano with real-time processing using Python OpenCV.
