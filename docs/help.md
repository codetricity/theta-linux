## FAQ

### Can I stream indefinitely?

The THETA Z1 can power off the USB-C port and stream at the same time.
Using USB 3.0 or better, the charge increases in our tests.  The
camera does get hot.  Upgrade to the latest firmware.  If possible,
attach a small fan to your tripod and point it at the body of the
THETA.

The V drains slowly.  It will last about 8 hours.  You may be able 
to bypass the battery, but this is not tested.
