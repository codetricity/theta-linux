Overview The RICOH THETA SC2 is a great, lightweight camera that takes good-looking 360\u00b0 pictures. Many people in the developer community have asked about building applications for the SC2. Although the SC2 camera appears to conform to the RICOH THETA Wi-Fi API, it is not listed on the official RICOH API site which we all use as our reference. Some developers have reported problems with the SC2 and the RICOH THETA SDK for features such as live preview. Other people have reported problems using the SC2 with the Google Streetview mobile app . The SC2 uses a slower MCU than the RICOH THETA V and Z1. The slower speed of the SC2 results in longer processing times for all API commands. This can cause problems if you run multiple API commands in sequence and do not check for completion of each command. There are extensive examples in this document and sample code that show how to use POST /osc/commands/status and POST /osc/state to verify that your previous API command is finished processing. This article organizes usage of the SC2 Wi-Fi API based on community testing. It is not an official RICOH document. Please contact RICOH for official information. HTTP API Testing Tools I am using THETA SC2 firmware 1.20 on a Windows 10 machine using the free API testing tool Talend API Tester . This API testing tool is similar to Postman . Another command line alternative is curl . If you prefer to write scripts for your tests, I find it easy and effective to use Python requests or any number of JavaScript libraries that can handle an HTTP request. This article makes extensive use of the Dart http package for both GET and POST requests. Dart was chosen for many tests as it almost as easy to use as Bash or Python for command line scripts and provides a smooth and easy way to test mobile apps on iOS and Android with Flutter . Connect Your Computer to the SC2 Turn the SC2 on and put it into Wi-Fi mode. You must connect your workstation to the SC2 with Wi-Fi. The hotspot password is the serial number (just the numerical digits). On Windows, click on the Wi-Fi icon in the lower-right of your screen. Select the THETAYP hotspot. In this example, the password is 20001005. There are no letters or dots in the default password. Once connected, the Wi-Fi icon on the front of the SC2 will be solid. If the Wi-Fi icon is still flashing, the camera is not connected. Troubleshooting Connection The THETA SC2 Wi-Fi only functions at 2.4GHz. The THETA V and the Z1 operate at both 2.4GHz and 5GHz. If you have an unstable Wi-Fi connection with the SC, try a different Wi-Fi dongle or laptop to isolate the problem. If you are working with multiple devices, make sure you are connecting to the correct camera. Put the camera right next to your development workstation. Moving the camera 5 feet away can make a difference. Turn off other Wi-Fi routers in the test area that may be causing Wi-Fi interference. If you have two network interfaces in your development workstation, make sure that your primary router is not at 192.168.1.1. The THETA SC2 will always be 192.168.1.1 in Access Point (AP) mode. Connection Limitations Compared to THETA V and Z1 SC2 only operates at 2.4GHz. The V and Z1 can also connect at 5GHz SC2 can only operate in Access Point (AP) mode. The V and Z1 can also operate in Client Mode (CL) You can use the official RICOH mobile app to check camera features. Compare the available SC2 settings in the image above to the THETA V settings in the image below.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#ricoh-theta-sc2-api","text":"Build Android iOS mobile apps for the SC2 and connect your mobile app to the camera with Wi-Fi using this API.","title":"RICOH THETA SC2 API"},{"location":"#overview","text":"The RICOH THETA SC2 is a great, lightweight camera that takes good-looking 360\u00b0 pictures.

The V/Z1 is faster in my experience. When you write your own program you should verify that the camera is ready for the next command with state or status . Although both state and status will work for takePicture in still image mode, you will need to use state if you use more advanced shots that require startCapture . Check camera availability with state The flow of your program will be as follows: <--- camera.takePicture ----> response <--- POST /osc/state ----> response _captureStatus: shooting <--- POST /osc/state ----> response _captureStatus: shooting <--- POST /osc/state ----> response _captureStatus: shooting <--- POST /osc/state ----> response _captureStatus: shooting <--- POST /osc/state ----> response _captureStatus: idle <--- GET URL *URL = _LatestFileUrl of the state received immediately before Check camera availability with status I used a network protocol analyzer log from both the RICOH mobile SDK and the official mobile app to see how these apps check for the readiness of the image to be download. Both apps are using status. Using status, the steps are: takePicture check on status of takePicture using the state property. if status shows state as inProgress, repeat check If the status shows state as done, get the URL of the laste image taken download file and save to disk. To use status, you must get the id of the /osc/command from the HTTP response of takePicture . Once you have the id , you can pass it to status . Put the check on the status in a loop with a delay in the loop to avoid overwhelming the camera and your logs. Here's an example of putting a delay of 1 second into the loop.

Code sample is available that saves thumbnails to local storage to help with testing. camera._getMetadata not working as expected Problem Description : Properties such as ExposureBiasValue are incorrect. Workaround : The correct metadata appears to be in the image file. Pull the actual image to your mobile phone and then use a library to extract the metadata in the image on your mobile phone. Do not use camera._getMetadata to pull the information if you suspect it is not providing you with the correct values. previewFormat width and height not working Problem Description : with getOptions, the previewFormat does not show correct values. width and height return 0. Workaround : There is no known workaround to set the width and height, but getLivePreview does appear to work. The preview format of the SC2 is fixed at 1024x512 at 30fps. Unlike the V and the Z1, the preview format cannot be changed to different fps and frame size. Examples of how to extract the JPEG frames from the MotionJPEG stream are available. If your mobile app checks the camera model, you can figure out what the size of the frames are on the SC2 without needing to use previewFormat. For SC2, the size is always 1024x512. camera.delete does not delete multiple images from camera Problem Description : camera.delete only deletes one image. The array of URLs and special parameters such as \"all\" and \"image\" do not work.

Problem Description : maxThumbSize: 640 does not show the thumbnails. The SC2 will freeze. There is no way to get the thumbnails. The listFiles command on the SC2 works differently than it does on the V and Z1. Workaround : As of August 11, 2020, we have thumbnails working with the SC2. You can get a base64 encoded thumbnail of approximately 7.3kB in size. Grab the URL of the file you want to get the thumbnail for and then specify it in _startFileUrl . Example in Dart map.

Unlike the V and the Z1, the preview format cannot be changed to different fps and frame size. Examples of how to extract the JPEG frames from the MotionJPEG stream are available.
